# student-informations
As a user, I would like to add students to a table so I can track the students in my system.

Create a form in order to add the student email, mobile and tuition. The tuition should be one of a predefined list that contains the following: 100JD, 500JD, 1000JD
As a user, I would like to view the student's id

each student should have a student id as a number (starting from 1).
As a user, I would like to view the student's name

each student should have a name (the name is splitted from the email eg ('ahmad@ltuc.com' => 'ahmad'))
As a user, I would like to view the age for each student.

whenever we add a new student, you should generate the student age as an integer random number between 18 and 24.
As a user, I would like to view all of my students that I already added.

Whenever you add a student using the form, you should use the local storage in order to get all the students from it and render them as a table using DOM.
As a user, I would like to view the total fee of all the students that I have in the table

whenever you add a new student, you should display the updated value of totals under the table
